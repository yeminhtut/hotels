Its collection of 21 contemporary Asian-inspired rooms is each with unique layout and spacious living areas spanning from 600 square-foot to over 2000 square-foot. The collage of natural elements with the prevalent use of timber, polished concrete and bamboo, creates a distinctively raw-yet-refined interior of earth stone and charcoal. Accented by burst of red, gold, silver or cream decor to display striking contrast, specks of exquisite Asian antiques also add a touch of old and new. This very concept of ''yin'' and ''yang'' created what labeled as Samadhi quintessential ''Rustic-Luxe'' experience.</p><p><b>SurroundingArea</b>Discreetly hidden from street view, the most distinguishing feature of Villa Samadhi is the massive, soaring grass thatched-roof that shouts ''Malaysia''. Open the bamboo-clad gate and the surprise is over, a facade is absolute russet harmony. One-of-a-kind in K Land tucked within an upscale locale, the villa is just 10 minutes drive from the vivacious parts of town like KLCC and Bukit Bin-tang.</p><p><b>RoomTypes</b>Luxe Crib - The Luxe Crib plays with the enhanced space it was granted to welcome you in. Space is a feature that is often overlooked, but at Villa Samadhi, it is considered as a most important element when designing our rooms; the Luxe Crib is fine example of this credo. There are nine of these rooms available, but no two Luxe Cribs are the same. One of the defining features of the Luxe Crib is its Jacuzzi; subject to availability, you can immerse your troubles away indoors or outdoors. Amenities include: WiFi connection, Ipod docking, private plunge poolSarang - Sarang is the home that you have never been to. There are five of these suites spread throughout the villa with one of them hosting two bedrooms. Where Sarang stands unique among its siblings is its kitchenette.

Amenities include: WiFi connection, Ipod docking, private plunge pool, kitchen.Luxe Sarang - A garden fully equipped with its own Jacuzzi welcomes you before you even step into this luxurious urban nest. There are four of these rooms available all throughout the villa. The defining feature of the Luxe Sarang besides the garden patio wherein one can laze and dine under a moon-lit sky; is its direct access to the pool. One can stroll through the room and straight into the cooling waters of our lagoon to wash the world away. Amenities include: WiFi connection, Ipod docking, private plunge pool in the private garden and direct access to swimming pool.The Loft - The one and only room exceptional to this design. The Loft got its name from the pyramid-ceiling structure which encloses the bed like an attic bedroom. This "nest" sits on the highest fllor of the villa with a spectacular feature of a shallow lap pool-sized dip pool with a far-reaching view of the surrounding neighbourhood, including a glimpse of the KL Twin Towers. Clearly intended to facilitate utter relaxation amid the urban drone, The Loft is the essence of contemporary comfort.
